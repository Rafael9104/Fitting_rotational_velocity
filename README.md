# Fitting_rotational_velocity
This program makes the fitting of rotational velocity of NGC 6503 galaxy using the Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) and Scalar Field Dark Matter (SFDM) density profiles.

## Download
If you are intended to use it download the git repository with
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Rafael9104/Fitting_rotational_velocity
```
then checkout to the cleaned branch of the repository
```
$ cd Fitting_rotational_velocity/
$ git checkout clean_up
```
Install the needed libraries that include: 'numpy', 'scipy', 'matplotlib'.

## Usage
To use it, run:
```
$ python Rotation_velocity_NGC6503.py
```
this will produce the data plot of rotational velocity and the fitting curves plot. It also gives estimated fit values ​​for the radius and density of the halo core.
